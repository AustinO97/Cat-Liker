Cat liker

ABOUT
Cat liker is a single page application that allows you to like any of the cats on the page. Users are also able to leave a comment or multiple comments about whichever cat they like. Users are able to add a cat to the page by typing the name of a cat, and pasting an img of the cat.

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION
The original 5 cats will be displayed on the page when it loads. Users may click the 'like' button above any cat they find they like. Users may also type in the 'Add Comment' section and either click 'enter' on their keyboard to submit the comment or click the 'submit' button. The 'Is Cute' button is a mouseover event, so if you hover your mouse over the button it will change the text inside the button from 'Is Cute' to 'True!'. All cats default to true for the 'Is Cute' button, because all of the cats are cute! Users may add a new cat to the page by adding a cat name and cat image to the text boxes below 'Add a new cat!'. Once the user has added a cat name and image to the text boxes, they can click the 'Add Cat' button and the cat they added will appear at the bottom of the page!
